## Step forward, I have a few things I want to tell you: ğŸ‘‡


I'm a young Applied Computer Science Student at WSEI in Krakow,

Although most of my repositories are just homework, sometimes I build something different and upload it here

Oh, apart from coding also I love DIY, electronics, cars (mainly working on mine), dancing, socializing... the list goes on and on
